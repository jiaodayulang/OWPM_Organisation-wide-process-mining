# OWPM_Organisation-wide-process-mining
## Introduction
The complexity of organisational processes is a key challenge for any organisation, especially for organisations with a large-scale and huge variety of processes. Comparatively, conducting process identification can help organisations to focus on processes having substantial problems at an early stage and deliver maximum value in BPM projects. This research presents a novel method for automated process identification using a data-drive approach and statistical process performance measurements. This method consists of two main steps: process enumeration and process selection. A systematic approach for process enumeration is proposed to automatically enumerate all possible processes from the event data scattered in various information systems. Then, a method for process selection is applied to evaluate the enumerated processes and assess them based on statistical process performance measurements. Our research shows the validity and efficiency of our method for process identification through experimental analysis using real-world data (MIMIC-III Clinical Database) and in-depth interviews with experts.
