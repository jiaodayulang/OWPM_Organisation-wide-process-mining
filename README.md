# OWPM_Organisation-wide-process-mining
The complexity of organisational processes is a key challenge for any organisation, especially for organisations with a huge variety of processes. While implementing business process management (BPM) projects can help organisations identify opportunities to improve operational efficiency, enhance service quality and reduce cost, it requires sufficient resources (people, funds and time) to conduct detailed process modelling, analyse and propose process redesign. Process identification, as the beginning of a BPM life-cycle, consists of management activities including defining the set of business processes occurring at an organisation level and selecting specific processes for BPM projects through applying clear criteria. Comparatively, conducting process identification can help organisations to focus on processes having substantial problems and deliver maximum value in BPM projects. This research presents a novel method for process identification using process mining techniques. This method consists of two main steps: process enumeration and process selection. A systematic approach for process enumeration is proposed to automatically enumerate all possible processes from the event data scattered in various information systems. Then, a method for process selection is applied to evaluate the enumerated processes and assess them based on specific criteria. Our research shows the validity and efficiency of our method for process identification through experimental analysis using real-world data and in-depth interviews with experts.
